      <h2>About Waples Machine</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Founded in 2020 by James Waples, Waples Machine is on a mission to create a best in class,
        open source, safe machine controller and ecosystem to empower users to control industrial
        machining centers at low cost.
      </p>

      <p>Many such motion controllers already exist, but none that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Are fully modular and encourage modification and expansion</li>
        <li>Are written end-to-end in the Rust programming language</li>
        <li>Provide a robust EtherCAT master written in Rust</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That's where Movements comes in. Leveraging the safety, ease of use and performance of Rust,
        we believe we can fill a gap in the market with an excellent machine controller solution.
